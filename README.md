Inspired by
[swiftmon](https://github.com/dimpiax/swiftmon).
But in Swift.
Hence the S. Like in *S*uper. Or *S*porty. Or *S*chwifty. Or *S*wifty.
Your choice.

What does it do? It automatically invokes `swift build` within a Swift Package Manager
project when files in the Sources folder are modified/added/deleted. Improving your
workflow if you don't use an IDE (no manual calls to `swift build` necessary).
